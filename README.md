# Introduction

The code of *Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#* with a few improvements.

It contains a C# implementation of the Payroll Case Study from Uncle Bob's book: Agile Software Development -
Principles, Patterns, and Practices.

Ch30_FinalPackaging comes from [FreekPaans/PPPPayrollCaseStudy](https://github.com/FreekPaans/PPPPayrollCaseStudy).
It's based on the original book (the Java one), and the rest are based on the C# one.

The adaptation to modern C# shouldn't change any behavior.

## Quick start

1. Make sure you have .NET 9.0 or above installed.
2. Run `dotnet run` in the terminal.
